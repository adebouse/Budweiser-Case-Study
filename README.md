# Budweiser-Case-Study
##Introduction: The purpose of the project is to present an analysis of the beer industry, then create a decision matrix that assists with chosing an expansion plan based on three options: 1) Buy an current brewery, 2) Build a new brewery, or 3)Expand current production levels. Since our data is based on historical information, we will assume precendent for our future assumption of establishing an "ideal" targeted location to allocate resources for expansion.
